# ml-supervised-regression

## Introduction
This project contains a .ipynb file and a .csv file. You can open the code file (.ipynb) file in Jupyter notebook and simply press the run icon to execute the code.

Underline code reads a csv file which has some fictional marketing spend and revenue data. Code tries to do a do a simple linear regression analysis between the marketing spend (assumed as independent variable) & revenue (assumed as dependent variable). 

At the end code generates scatter plot to see how the predicted and actual values they stack together; and also how to root mean square error (rmse) and r squared variance looks like.
